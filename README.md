# Tenderloin

Tenderloin is a simple push based service that, when paired with the Golden Gate chrome extension allows for the remote control of Google+ Hangouts.

## Say what?

We at Unified are big fans of inter-room communication. We have a persistent Google+ hangout between the two development rooms. Tenderloin and Golden Gate allow us to control certain aspects of the sessions, such as toggling the camera and microphones in each room as well as playing alert noises to attract the attention on the other side.
